# untranquil

A collection of random fun pages to test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They do not serve any purpose other than just being fun to mess around with. 

## [untranquil](https://dtsivkovski.github.io/untranquil/untranquil)

A little page made as a joke. Test it out and experience the wonders of untranquil.

## [physics box](https://dtsivkovski.github.io/untranquil/forcebox)

A small page testing out animations as a way to make a (slightly inaccurate) physics simulation.

## [circle rotate](https://dtsivkovski.github.io/untranquil/circlerotate)

A page to test a CSS and JavaScript transition between two images using rotating circles.

## [phone number](https://dtsivkovski.github.io/untranquil/phone-number)

A very, very frustrating phone number selector.
